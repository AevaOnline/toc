# Introduction

With the adoption of Hardware Trusted Execution Environments (HW TEEs), also
known as Enclaves, by commercial cloud vendors and the growth of both open
source and commercial projects enabling their use, there is an increased
interest in improving the operational security within cloud native deployments
by leveraging the unique capabilities of this new class of hardware.

While the center of gravity for Confidential Computing projects lies within the
CCC, this SIG provides a space for CNCF projects to coalesce and discuss the
best ways to leverage this new technology.

# SIG Mission Statement

The Confidential Computing SIG exists to enable widespread use of HW TEEs and improve the security of cloud-native workloads through the following actions:

1. **Clarify and inform.** Provide valuable and objective information to the TOC, End User and Projects of the CNCF regarding areas considered in-scope. Strengthen the project ecosystem to meet the needs of end users and project contributors. Educate and inform users with unbiased, effective, and practically useful information.
2. **Collaborate and interrelate.** Effectively interface with other related groups internal and external to the CNCF and connect the dots to facilitate meaningful collaborative progression of relevant topics. Engage more communities and create an on-ramp to effective TOC contribution &amp; recognition.
3. **Assist and attract projects.** Helping to maintain the continued health of CNCF projects that utilize Confidential Computing technologies (both hardware and software). Focus attention and resources on helping foster project maturity and interoperability across CNCF projects. Clarify relationship between projects, CNCF project staff, and community volunteers. Identify gaps in the landscape of CNCF TEE-related projects. Find and attract projects to fill these gaps through invitation to present, diligence on proposed projects, and in essence, act as a funnel for TOC project reviews in this area.
4. **Afford impartial stewardship.** Provide and maintain a vendor neutral venue for relevant thought validation, discussion, and project feedback. Establish procedures to assist where necessary.

# Responsibilities &amp; Deliverables



## Responsibilities


## Deliverables

- **Proposed project review** - a pre-review of upcoming project proposed for adoption, allowing projects to have a soft review, gauge and garner CNCF interest.
  - Provide recommendations for new CNCF projects.
- **New projects** - recommendation of sandbox projects where exploration is needed.
- **SIG reports to TOC** - scheduled regular reporting to ToC on ongoing and completed work.
- **Cloud Native networking whitepaper(s)** - framework document for the cloud native traffic and networking space.
- Cloud Native Networking Patterns
- **Network Landscape** - a deeper and category-specific project landscape (e.g. [service mesh landscape](https://layer5.io/landscape)).
- **Existing project review** - review of previously adopted projects as a health check of projects in the category.
